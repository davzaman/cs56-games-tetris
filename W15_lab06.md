There are a fair amount of issues I could tackle with this project.
I dont think I will end up getting to them all, however. 

Build.xml:
	- **Game no longer compiles after running ant clean**
	I found the error was that the test file was calling a test method that used an invalid constructor. I need to inspect the code more fully to be able to completely fix the test cases, but I at least fixed it enough so that it would compile. 

1:
	-"# cs56-games-tetris

	A classic game of Tetris."
	- very bare README.md, perhaps more could be added to it, like a description of the GUI.

2:
	- Currently the first couple blocks change color after being placed at the bottom of the screen. I don't believe that this behavior is intended.

3:
	Pretty good test coverage in BlockTest. BoardTest would not compile, need to fix that file.

7: Most code is uncommented. Javadoc comments would be very helpful to know 	the purpose of certain functions.

GUI additions:
	- Enlarge the tetris window screen size.
	- fix color changing blocks bug
	- Improve the GUI to include a main menu and play button.
	- Add a Button for a "Rules" menu
	- Add music button that can be toggled on or off
	- make the GUI feel more like an established game 

Gameplay Additions:
	- Add a rotate function to rotate the tetris game pieces.
	- Add a function to speed up block fall rate with down arrow key.

Low Hanging Fruit I fixed:
	- Cleaned up Build.xml file
	- Specifically, I Removed Publish and Download tasks, and removed appropriate delete tasks from clean. I Changed the hardcoded jar file and changed pathelement location to ./lib. I also set includeantruntime="false" on javac task to remove error during compilation.
